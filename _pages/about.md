## About me
Hi, I'm __Kaylee__.
I am an undergraduate student in CS & DS at [University of Wisconsin -- Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) and Prof.[Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/).

My research interest is the foundation of machine learning, especially machine learning efficiency and automated machine learning. I am eager to come up with new ideas to help **reduce the need for expensive labeled data**. I am also working on broadening the scope of machine learning methods toward **the long tail of diverse and under-studied application fields**--far beyond well-explored domains such as vision and NLP.
