## About me
Hi, I'm __Kaylee__.
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/)  Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Data Science at [University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), where I worked with Prof. [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) and Prof. [Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/).

My research interest is efficient machine learning, especially weak supervision, AutoML, and large-scale data analysis. I am eager to come up with new ideas to help **reduce the need for expensive labeled data**. I am also working on broadening the scope of machine learning methods toward **the long tail of diverse and under-studied application fields** -- far beyond well-explored domains such as vision and NLP.
