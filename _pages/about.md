## About me
Hi, I'm __Kaylee__.
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/).  Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Data Science at [University of Wisconsin – Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), where I worked with Prof. [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) and Prof. [Jelena Diakonikolas](https://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/).

My research focuses on efficient machine learning, with a particular interest in reasoning and multimodality. I aim to enhance multimodal reasoning ability by encouraging models to leverage **non-textual modalities more effectively**. I have also developed methods to **mitigate hallucination and reduce catastrophic forgetting** during multimodal instruction tuning.
Beyond multimodal reasoning, my broader work in **reinforcement learning based post-training** focuses on improving reasoning efficiency and stability in both text-only and multimodal models. Over the past summer, I have been developing methods for **long-to-short reasoning**.

Please get in touch with me via email if you would like to discuss research or potential collaborations!
